      <p>Upon release, the game received positive reviews, with praise aimed at the soundtrack, story, graphics, humor, voice acting, combat and gameplay, though criticism was aimed at the frustrating partner AI and glitches.

      <p>Unlike previous games in the series which were mostly single-player-only games, All 4 One focuses on a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode which allows for drop-in and drop-out online as well as offline multiplayer. Players can each take the role of one of the four main characters of the game, namely Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Doctor Nefarious.</p>
