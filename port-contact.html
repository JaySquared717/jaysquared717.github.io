          <p>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a third-person action-adventure title, with elements of platforming, shooting, role-playing games, and puzzle-solving. Players explore many planets to complete objectives, obtain an infobot that provides coordinates to another planet, and progress through the story. Along the way, they acquire many weapons and gadgets, as well as earn bolts, the main form of currency in the series, which can be used to purchase new weaponry and many other in-game items.</p>

    <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>While the core third-person action-adventure gameplay is similar to the previous entry, Going Commando features notably more role-playing game elements, allowing players to upgrade both their nanotech (health) and weapons by defeating enemies through absorbing their nanomites. Players are also given more weapons and armor to purchase at Megacorp vendors with collected bolts. There are also many more challenges, such as gladiator battles and hoverbike races, which they can participate in to earn bolts (or alternatively raritanium to upgrade their ship). Players are still required to complete objectives on planets to unlock new planets or to obtain gadgets required to complete other objectives and progress the story.</p>

        <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Up Your Arsenal is a third-person action-adventure title with elements of shooting, role playing, puzzle solving, and vehicle driving. It is the first in the series to feature both single player and both offline and online multiplayer gameplay, in which the single player game gives the player control of Ratchet and Clank through the story mode in which they travel from planet to planet to stop Dr. Nefarious, while the multiplayer mode allows teams to compete on a map against one another to capture a base, a flag, or rack up enough kills against opponents. Both modes allow the player to collect a wide arsenal of upgradeable weapons, use gadgets to traverse large environments, and drive ground and air vehicles.</p>

        <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Size Matters</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Size Matters features much the same gameplay as seen in Up Your Arsenal and other previous home console entries in the series. It is a third person action adventure game with elements of shooting, platforming, and minigames, with both single player and multiplayer gameplay. It features the Shrink Ray, which allows Ratchet and Clank to shrink down to reach certain areas or hack into locks. A few elements are slightly more simplified, such as weapons leveling only up to V4 as opposed to the usual V5. Despite the control scheme being remapped for the PlayStation Portable, Ratchet is still capable of performing most of his normal moveset. The game features an entirely new armor system, allowing Ratchet to gain pieces of full armor sets, which can be combined to create different sets to achieve varying armor bonuses and OmniWrench 10K effects.</p>

        <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Future Tools of Destruction</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Tools of Destruction is a return to the third-person action adventure gameplay from the original three entries on the PlayStation 2, with elements of shooting, role-playing, platforming, puzzle-solving and on-rails space combat. Ratchet can collect all-new weapons which can be upgraded through use and now through Raritanium, as well as gadgets to overcome obstacles. The game introduces devices, which are rarer, non-upgradable support weapons. Clank has his own gameplay sections that allow him to command the Zoni to complete stages. Tools of Destruction also introduces a few gameplay elements controlled by the PlayStation 3 SIXAXIS tilt functionality.</p>

        <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Quest for Booty</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Quest for Booty uses very similar gameplay to Tools of Destruction, with all weapons originating from the latter. It mainly differs in that Ratchet is without Clank, and now makes of an OmniWrench Millennium 12, which contains a kinetic tether allowing him to move obstacles and manipulate objects, while also allowing him to pick up and throw items with the wrench.</p>

        <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: A Crack in Time</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>A Crack in Time is a third person three dimensional action game with elements of platforming, shooting, role playing, puzzle solving and open exploration. The player controls Ratchet, a lombax who wields an arsenal of weapons, gadgets, and flies a sentient starship known as the Aphelion, and Clank, a robot trainee for the role of Caretaker in the Great Clock who can make use of his Chronoscepter to manipulate time. Ratchet retains much of his core moveset, as well as make use of the OmniWrench Millennium 12 ability to manipulate objects, with the main new addition being the Hoverboots that allow him to traverse environments very quickly. Clank's use of the Chronoscepter and ability to create temporal recordings make his puzzle-solving gameplay vastly different from previous titles.</p>

        <h3>Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One</h3>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Gameplay consists of firefights with a varied arsenal of weapons like previous games, but it is largely centered around cooperative gameplay mechanics. Players will often have to cooperate and rely on each other to progress though a level, but Insomniac has been careful to keep All 4 One enjoyable at the same time. "We had gameplay mechanics where one player would do something and the other three were waiting for them to do it. It was just intensely boring. Waiting around is not a lot of fun," said Mike McManus, a gameplay programmer at Insomniac.</p>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Full Frontal Assault single-player features three playable characters: Qwark, Ratchet and Clank although in co-op, only two can be played at a time. Full Frontal Assault is designed to have more replayability than Quest for Booty. Medals are awarded based on the player's performance in the tower defense segments, encouraging the player to replay these as medals unlock new perks and armors for Ratchet, Clank and Qwark. Skill Points return and unlock a variety of options with 117 skill points in total. There are also other time-based challenges in the form of Insomniac Challenge Times for campaign mode.</p>

Ratchet has a similar core moveset to previous entries with an updated control scheme, has many returning weapons and gadgets, as well as several new ones with a focus on gravity manipulation and interaction with the Netherverse. Clank has entirely new gameplay sections, which are two dimensional sidescrolling sections in which he is sent to the Netherverse, and crosses this environment by manipulating its gravity.</p>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>Like the original Ratchet &amp; Clank, this re-imagining is a third-person action-adventure game with elements of platforming, shooting, and puzzle solving, though it features many updates. It features an arsenal of weapons taken from previously released games in the series, along with some new additions. There is also the ability to upgrade weapons with use up to V5, and upgrade nanotech health that was not present in the original. Most gadgets and minigames remain intact from the original, albeit updated slightly. Many planets are updated versions of the original entry, with planets, in some cases, being altered in level structure, merged with a planet that did not appear, or an entirely new addition. Holocards earned throughout the game contain many references to the story and lore of past entries in the series' history.</p>

         <div class="games text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
             <p>The gameplay of Rift Apart allows the player to play both as Ratchet and Rivet, although they both play identically, sharing weapons and gadgets.
