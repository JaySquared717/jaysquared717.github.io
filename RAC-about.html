        <h3>Overview</h3>
      <div class="about text-bg-light p-3 text-center">   
          <p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One is a game for the PlayStation 3 developed by Insomniac Games. It is the 9th installment in the Ratchet &amp; Clank series and takes place two years after the events of Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time. The game is a platformer shooter; however, it relies on a four player co-operative system where the players can choose to play as either Ratchet, Clank, Qwark or Dr. Nefarious. It is the first spin-off game in the series by Insomniac Games. The two year gap between All 4 One and it's the preceding game, Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time, is bridged by the Ratchet &amp; Clank comic series.</p>

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <div class="about text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
          <p>The game began when Galactic President Captain Qwark went to the city of Luminopolis to receive an "Intergalactic Tool of Justice Award." He asked Ratchet and Clank to escort him which, in reality, was a part of Dr. Nefarious's latest plan. During the "ceremony," Nefarious unleashed a Light-Eating Z'Grute on the city of Luminopolis, which was eventually defeated by Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Nefarious himself, who after being abandoned by Lawrence had no choice but to help the heroes fight the creature. However, the rare creature attracted the attention of Ephemeris the Creature Collector, and the foursome were kidnapped and dumped on planet Magnus. When Cronk and Zephyr failed to successfully reach the planet and rescue the four, the team decided to band together to find their way home. They later found out Ephemeris was using Magnus as an open-air reserve for the universe's most dangerous creatures, which terrorized the locals. The team was rescued by a little girl. Although hesitantly, Ratchet and Clank postponed their retirement vacation and set off to stop Ephemeris. With no other way to get home, Qwark and Nefarious begrudgingly joined the two heroes. After the team traveled to the Deadgrove, they found out Ephemeris was guarded by Commander Spog. The team found N.E.S.T, a base of operations for Spog, and after a long battle found out from a beaten Sprog that Ephemeris was controlled by Nevo Binklemeyer, a long-time friend of Dr. Frumpus Croid.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <div class="about text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
          <p>Gameplay consists of firefights with a varied arsenal of weapons like previous games, but it is largely centered around cooperative gameplay mechanics. Players will often have to cooperate and rely on each other to progress though a level, but Insomniac has been careful to keep All 4 One enjoyable at the same time. "We had gameplay mechanics where one player would do something and the other three were waiting for them to do it. It was just intensely boring. Waiting around is not a lot of fun," said Mike McManus, a gameplay programmer at Insomniac.</p>

        <h3>Multiplayer system</h3>
        <div class="about text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
          <p>All 4 One adds a four-player drop-in drop-out co-op system to the classic Ratchet &amp; Clank formula. The four players can be local, through the use of multiple controllers; online players, through the use of PlayStation Network; or, in the case of a single player, one AI character controlled by the CPU. Voice chat is supported. Players can drop in or out at any time during gameplay. If you play alone, you will have the choice of playing as Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, or Dr. Nefarious. If you choose Ratchet, Qwark, or Dr. Nefarious, an AI controlled Clank will ride on your back and hop off to fight enemies and help in sections that require two players. Any combination of characters can be used when playing single player, such as a miniaturised Qwark that hops onto Clank's back in singleplayer and jumps off in combat in full-size. As players progress through the game, they build up a profile associated with their PSN ID. When players join an online game hosted by another player's profile, they get to keep "some things" associated with their profile, one of which is trophies. Players can also login to their profile on another PS3 to keep those "things" when playing.</p>

        <h3>Weapons and gadgets</h3>
        <div class="about text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
          <p>Weapons are more powerful when used cooperatively. The Combuster, for example, adapts to All 4 One's cooperative nature by multiplying damage as more players fire at an enemy. New weapons like the Darkstar Fission Tether and Thundersmack are made for multiplayer. Electric energy beams connect player's Darkstar tethers together, creating a web of electricity which can be moved around of slice through groups of enemies or damage a larger enemy. Weapon upgrades can be purchased with bolts.</p>

        <h3>Critical reception</h3>
        <div class="about text-bg-light p-3 text-center">
          <p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One received mixed-average reviews. It achieved a score of 70 out of 100 at Metacritic and 70.63% at GameRankings. The game overall sold 1.5 million copies. It was given a "Great" 8 out of 10 rating by IGN who praised the fun multiplayer gameplay and puzzle sections. However, they did say that the story and graphics were not as good as the previous Ratchet &amp; Clank game, Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack in Time. GameInformer also praised the game's co-operative gameplay, giving it a 8.75 out of 10.</p>
