      <div class="about">
        <p>Unlike previous games in the series which were mostly single-player-only games, All 4 One focuses on a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode which allows for drop-in and drop-out online as well as offline multiplayer. Players can each take the role of one of the four main characters of the game, namely Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Doctor Nefarious.</p>

      <div class="about">
        <p>All 4 One adds a four-player drop-in drop-out co-op system to the classic Ratchet &amp; Clank formula. The four players can be local, through the use of multiple controllers; online players, through the use of PlayStation Network; or, in the case of a single player, one AI character controlled by the CPU.</p>

      <div class="about">
        <p>Before the game was released, fan reception was mixed, with the major complaint being the focus of four-player co-op. All 4 One received polarized reviews, with a Metacritic score of 70/100 indicating "mixed or average reviews". IGN gave the game an 8/10 citing as a step backwards from A Crack in Time. The most negative review has come from Destructoid who gave the game 4/10 and said "Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One should have been about $15, five hours shorter, and released on the PlayStation Network. It's a game that does a disservice to the high pedigree of the Ratchet &amp; Clank series and takes too far a departure from what made such an excellent series". GameSpot gave the game a 7 out of 10. Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out of 10, saying "This Is One For All The Fans Of Co-op Platforming." Morgan Webb of X-Play gave the game a 3 out of 5, praising the variety, story, and saying it will keep fans satisfied for the next game, but criticizing the glitches, easy puzzles, and more kid-friendly tone.</p>
